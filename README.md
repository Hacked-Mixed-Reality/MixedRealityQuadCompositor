# OBS Mixed Reality Quad Compositor

## Introduction

This plugin was generated from the OBS plugin template, and is meant to make it easier to composite the quadrants generated by games that do not have native LIV support. 

## Prerequisites
OBS Minimum version 28.0.0.

Although it can be used to create Augmented Reality by cutting out just the background of a scene, it is recommended to be used in conjunction with Exceldro's Source clone to make a two-step compositor. https://obsproject.com/forum/resources/source-clone.1632/

## Usage

Assuming you already have your quad output added to the scene,

1. Add two `Source Clone` sources to your scene, cloning the Quad Output in each one. You will probably want to name them something helpful like `Cloned Foreground` and `Cloned Background`
2. Add a filter to each of the clones. For the foreground choose `Quad Compositor Foreground` and for the background choose `Quad Compositor Background`

And that should be it. All you need to do is make sure your sources are placed in the following order:

1. Cloned Foreground
2. Keyed Camera
3. Cloned Background

You can save some resources by ticking the clone option `Active Source` and then making your original Quad Output hidden.

## Building from source

Nothing exotic going on here, so this can be built using the scripts in the scripts folder.
